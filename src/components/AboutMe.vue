        <p>I am Ozan Deniz, <b>a full-stack developer</b> . I was born in 1990.</p>
        <p>I graduated in 2013 with a degree in <b>Computer Engineering</b> from the European University of Lefke.</p>

            My journey in development began when I was 10 years old, coding PHP pages and writing scripts for game servers of a classic MMORPG called Ultima Online. During my college years, I was introduced to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which became the foundation of my development expertise. After extensively honing my skills in OOP, I ventured into game development.

            My first game, The Fate of Vegeta, was a Flash game. With the decline of Flash, I explored alternatives and eventually adopted Unity as my primary game development platform. Using Unity, I developed several games, ranging from single-player to multiplayer online titles. For my online games, I built and continuously refined a custom game server in C++ to meet evolving requirements.

            In addition to game development, I have expertise in web development. I have mastered JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, Primevue, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and more to create engaging websites. My skill set extends beyond codingâ€”I have advanced proficiency in Photoshop and Illustrator, which I use for design and graphics work.
